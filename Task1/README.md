# Usage:

`npm run dev` | Run app with nodemon.

`npm run prod` | Run app normally.

`npm test` | Jest testing.

# Endpoint

GET /:artistName, for example, Michael_Jackson (spaces are underscores).

# Vue.js

I have not created a Vue.js app, but an embedded component inside the html.

You can search for the artist you want in the textbox.

TODO: Show album thumbnails instead of urls.
TODO: You can only have one artist per refresh. Once you have searched for one it is needed to refresh the page.
